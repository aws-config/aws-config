- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aws-config
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in sharing code samples for AWS Config Custom rules and Conformance Packs
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m am not an official AWS repository maintained by AWS and all code samples contained here
- have no warranty. Please ensure you review and fully understand any templates or code you copy,
- pull, or download from here (or else where in the Internet), before you build/run/deploy.

<!---
aws-config/aws-config is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
